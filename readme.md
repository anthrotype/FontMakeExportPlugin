### FontMake export plugin

An export plugin for Glyphs that uses fontMake and glyphsLib to export fonts. When installed, it shows up in the regular Export dialog (Cmd+E).

It will install its own environment and downloads the latest version of required libraries. These are stored inside the plugin and thus are removed when the plugin is deleted.

The "Command line options" accept whatever fontMake accepts. 

There is a "Update FontMake" option: the gear button in the bottom right.
